# Introduction

This repository is an extension of Reactâ€™s tic-tac-toe tutorial for further practice. It was created using vite and further extended:

- improved design using material-ui
- added postcss for postprocessing
- display which player's turn it is in the move history
- end the game if no more move is possible
